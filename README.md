A testbed for learning basic java functions and the language's syntax. 
It's a small program that uses key inputs from users to emulate the function of a ordering system for a restaurant.

TODO
Let the user to delete some thing from his order.
Combine items when multiple same items are ordered.
Refactor it to use a flexible data structure , as now arrays are used but are not ideal.
Connect it to a simple front end, and create an user and an admin web interface.
Clean up my code and make it as DRY as possible, as i'm learning new things in Java.
